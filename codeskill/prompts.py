The user prompt provides light task context, 2-3 related trajectories, and optional result summaries.

Choose exactly one action: `generate` to create one bootstrap skill, or `skip` to create no skill.

1. A bootstrap skill is a task-level reusable pattern supported by multiple trajectories. It must be broader than a single local event.
2. Generate only if the pattern is reusable across similar tasks. Keep `when_to_apply` high-level and write transferable, actionable rules.
3. Ground every part of the skill in repeated evidence from the trajectories and outcomes. Do not invent unsupported steps, checks, or guidance. If failed trajectories reveal reusable cautions, include them as cautionary rules.
4. Skip if evidence is weak, contradictory, accidental, too local, or collapses into an event-level reaction instead of a task-level pattern.
5. Do not include repository names, issue descriptions, exact task goals, variable names, function names, class names, module names, exact file paths, or one-off literals.

1. An event-driven skill is a local trigger-response pattern. It must focus on one important event inside the trajectory and stay narrower than a whole-task workflow.
2. Generate only if the event yields a reusable lesson beyond this exact task. Keep `when_to_apply` transferable and write local actionable rules.
3. Ground the trigger and guidance in the trajectory and result. Do not invent an event that is not clearly present. Failure-derived cautions are valid if clearly supported.
4. If multiple candidate events exist, choose the single most reusable one.
5. Skip if there is no strong reusable local event, or if the lesson is too task-specific or workflow-level.

The user prompt provides one or more relevant skills, one trajectory, and optional result summary.

1. Alignment and need for revision. Choose evolve only when one existing skill is clearly aligned with the current trajectory context and trigger pattern, and the current trajectory result shows that this aligned skill should be revised. If multiple skills are aligned and all are plausible revision targets, choose the single one that is most worth revising based on the strength and reusability of the evidence. The revision should be motivated by the observed outcome, such as a missing case, missing check, bad ordering, misleading guidance, or reusable caution.
2. Reusability and rule writing. Revise the skill only if the trajectory reveals a reusable missing case, missing check, better decision rule, improved ordering, or reusable caution. Rules should contain the revised reusable core of the skill as actionable guidance.
3. Applicability. `when_to_apply` should remain at a high transferable level rather than concrete task text.
4. Grounding. The revision must be directly supported by the provided trajectory and result. Do not add unsupported refinements.
5. Identity preservation. Keep the same capability identity. Do not drift into a different skill.
6. When to skip. Choose skip if the evidence is weak, contradictory, too local, or if the trajectory is better described as a brand-new skill rather than a revision.

Task
Judge a proposed merge decision in skill-bank maintenance.

- {{CANDIDATE_PRIOR_KNOWLEDGE}}
- {{EXISTING_PRIOR_KNOWLEDGE}}

Dimensions
- target_choice_correct, 0-3. Q1: the chosen target's when_to_apply directly matches the candidate's trigger condition. Q2: the chosen target has the closest underlying capability among all existing entries. Q3: no other existing entry would be equally good or better.
- target_overlap_substantive, 0-3. Q1: candidate and target have at least 30% conceptual rule overlap. Q2: their when_to_apply fields describe truly overlapping situations. Q3: keeping both separately would harm the bank through duplicate retrieval, conflict, or noise.
- merge_integration_quality, 0-3. Q1: overlapping rules are deduplicated and consolidated. Q2: the merged when_to_apply covers both original trigger conditions. Q3: the merged skill is internally consistent.
- identity_preserved, 0-3. Q1: the merged title preserves the target's broad capability. Q2: the merged granularity matches or sensibly subsumes the target's granularity. Q3: the merged skill would be retrieved in roughly the same situations as the original target.
- no_critical_loss_target, 0-3. Q1: every actionable rule from the original target is preserved, absorbed, or correctly deduplicated. Q2: target-specific orderings, exceptions, or cautions remain represented. Q3: target edge cases and trigger qualifiers remain intact.
- no_critical_loss_candidate, 0-3. Q1: every actionable rule from the candidate is preserved, absorbed, or deduplicated. Q2: the candidate's distinctive insights are preserved or strengthened. Q3: candidate-specific trigger conditions are reflected in the merged result.
- merged_when_to_apply_tightness, 0-3. Q1: the merged applicability is no broader than the union of candidate and target triggers. Q2: it retains enough cues for a future agent to decide when not to retrieve it. Q3: it contains no over-generalized trigger such as "any build issue" or "any failure with logs".
